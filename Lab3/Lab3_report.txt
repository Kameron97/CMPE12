			Lab 3 report

	So the first thing i did for this lab, was to write it in Java so I
	understand the procedure to follow in Assembly.

	So for my specific algorithm,  I followed the given flow chart given to
	us by the professor. What this Algorithm was , it basically checked if
	it was negative first, by checking for a "-" sign which is -48 in ASCII.
	if  it was, i added one to it and made it start from the begginging. If
	if it wasnt I minused 48 from it and then made it loop 10 times by
	by adding itself 10 times.

	This was an extrmeely difficult lab. Hardest one so far. Assembly so
	much different than java or C, so I could not really transfer my Java
	code easily to assembly. I had to take extra steps since assembly does
	not have all the functions of java by default. I got ALOT of help from
	video tutorials and the Tas.
